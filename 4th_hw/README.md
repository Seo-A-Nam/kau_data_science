# Utils
- this is the code getting correlation coef values between 'Attrition' and all the other variables
- 'get_all_cor.r' made some kinda error when i put it in assignment4.r file. so i just split it.
- 'select_attributes.r' is hardcoded code to map all the non-numeric values to sequenctial numbers
